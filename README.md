E-commerce Sales Analysis | Pizza Sales Analysis

Welcome to the Sales Data Analysis project, where we delve into the world of data-driven decision-making through the exploration of two distinct sales domains - E-commerce and Pizza Sales. This repository houses the code and insights from our data analysis efforts, leveraging a powerful tech stack that includes Power BI, SQL, and Python. Additionally, we've harnessed the art of web scraping using Python tools like Beautiful Soup to extract valuable data.

Project Highlights:
E-commerce Sales Analysis
Objective: In this project, we aimed to uncover valuable insights into the E-commerce sales landscape. We analyzed sales data to identify trends, customer behavior, and opportunities for revenue growth.

Tools and Technologies: We harnessed the power of Power BI to create interactive visualizations, SQL for data extraction and transformation, and Python to handle data scraping using Beautiful Soup.

Key Insights: Discover what drives E-commerce sales, the impact of marketing campaigns, and how customer demographics influence purchasing decisions.

Pizza Sales Analysis
Objective: Our Pizza Sales Analysis project takes a deep dive into the world of pizza delivery and sales. We explored data related to pizza orders, customer preferences, and sales performance.

Tools and Technologies: Similar to the E-commerce project, we used Power BI, SQL, and Python, with a focus on data scraping techniques to gather pizza-related information.

Key Insights: Unearth the most popular pizza toppings, optimal delivery times, and factors influencing pizza sales.

Tech Stack and Methodology:
Power BI: Create visually appealing and interactive dashboards for data exploration and storytelling.

SQL: Manage and manipulate data stored in databases to extract valuable information for analysis.

Python: Utilize Python for data scraping using Beautiful Soup, data preprocessing, and in-depth analysis.
